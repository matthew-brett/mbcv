On movement neuroscience
------------------------

From 1996-99 I studied PET imaging of apraxia and movement selection
supervised by David Brooks and John Stein. From 1999-2003 I worked on movement
selection with John Duncan at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit.  I
supervised two graduate students on movement neuroscience PhDs (see below).
Between 2003 |--| 2005 I worked on motor neuroscience with Rich Ivry in
Berkeley.

On imaging methods
------------------

Highlights:

* Author of a series of popular tutorials on imaging statistics and multiple
  comparison correction (see *online tutorials* in publication list). The
  tutorial on multiple comparisons became a book chapter in a standard
  reference on functional imaging analysis (Brett |et al| 2007).
* Work on warping images of damaged brains to standard brain templates
  (Brett |et al| 2001) (532 citations);
* Brett, Johnsrude and Owen 20001 review on ways of identifying location of brain activation, cited 913
  times;
* Nichols, Brett |et al| 2005 described an error in the  statistical procedure
  for so-called "conjunction analysis" in the standard SPM functional imaging
  software (1106 citations);
* One of six authors of the standard reference paper on reporting guidelines
  for functional MRI (Poldrack |et al| 2008);
* With Rebecca Saxe and Nancy Kanwisher, a defence of the region of interest
  technique for analysing FMRI data (Saxe |et al| 2006).
* With Jean-Baptiste Poline, a review and tutorial paper on the general linear
  model in functional MRI for a recent special issue of NeuroImage (Poline and
  Brett 2012).

Open-source scientific computing
================================

Metrics:

* http://depsy.org/person/344202 -- see [#depsy]_.  I am on the 99th centile
  for research code impact;
* https://github.com/matthew-brett;
* https://www.openhub.net/accounts/matthew-brett;

Grants:

* Berkeley 2004 -- 2006; with Jarrod Millman, I initiated a proposal to
  develop an international collaboration with statisticians, signal- and
  image-processing experts to write a new open software library for functional
  imaging analysis.  The NIH funded this proposal as a 3-year R01 grant from
  2007-2010 (Grant no 5R01MH081909-02).  The program became the Nipy project
  |--| http://nipy.org (see below);

Software (highlights; see metrics):

* Main author and maintainer of the `MarsBaR
  <http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/>`_ region of interest toolbox for
  region-of-interest analyses in brain imaging.  The toolbox continues to be
  in wide general use, and the abstract for MarsBaR has been cited nearly 2000
  times (see publications);
* With Federico Turkheimer and John Aston, author of the `PhiWave
  <http://phiwave.sourceforge.net/>`_ Toolbox for wavelet analysis of brain
  images.  We used Phiwave for an analysis for a competition at the Human
  Brain Mapping Conference (Aston, Turkheimer and Brett, 2006).  I published
  all the scripts for the analysis to make it reproducible [#fiac-analysis]_.
  I believe this is the first publication of a reproducible paper in
  neuroimaging;
* Lead developer and maintainer of `nipy <http://nipy.org/nipy>`_, an FMRI
  analysis package written in Python.  Nipy was NIH funded and is an
  international collaboration of imaging researchers from the USA, France,
  Switzerland and the UK. Rated at 97th centile for research impact by Depsy
  [#depsy-nipy]_;
* Lead developer and maintainer of `nibabel <http://nipy.org/nibabel>`_.
  Nibabel is the standard Python toolbox for reading and writing neuroimaging
  data formats.  Depsy rates nibabel at 100th centile for research impact
  [#depsy-nibabel]_;
* Third developer by code commits for `dipy <http://nipy.org/nibabel>`_ |--|
  the standard Python package for analysis of diffusion imaging data.
  Depsy-rated 99th centile for research impact [#depsy-dipy]_.

All our ``nipy.org``-based projects (including ``nipy, nibabel, dipy``) use
open-source best practice for software development, including distributed
version control based at http://github.com/nipy, full web-based code review,
and automated code testing.
