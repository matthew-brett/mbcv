\begin{cvSubSection}{Methods leadership}

\PlaceDateNote{Increasing true findings in imaging}{2005--present}
{Author of the first (to my knowledge) fully reproducible imaging analysis
(Aston {\em et al} 2006).  Piloted and implemented new teaching methods
designed to increase the quality and efficiency of scientific computing
practice in imaging and statistics (see Methods Teaching)}

\PlaceDateNote{Development strategy}{2005--present}
{Standard imaging software uses languages unsuitable for large projects
    (MATLAB, C) and / or scientific developers (C, C++).  This makes large
    projects stagnate, discourages scientist developers, and encourages
    uncritical application of software recipes.  Identified Python as the
future standard for scientific development, and started long-term project to
develop open international projects for imaging analysis in Python (see
Computing leadership, Selected software).  }

\PlaceDateNote{Methods reporting}{2008}
{One of six authors on the standard guidelines for reporting an FMRI study
(Poldrack {\em et al} 2008).}

\PlaceDateNote{Hypothesis testing}{2001--present}
{Much initial research followed the emphasis of imaging software on
    exploratory analysis rather than testing anatomical hypotheses.
    Implemented small volume correction methods for SPM software, and wrote
    MarsBaR -- a widely used region-of-interest analysis toolbox for SPM (see
Selected software).  With Rebecca Saxe, Nancy Kanwisher, advocated
region-of-interest methods (Saxe {\em et al} 2006).}

\PlaceDateNote{Understanding imaging statistics}{1996--present}
{It is common for researchers to find it difficult to relate the statistics
    they have been taught to the statistics implemented in neuroimaging
    software.  Wrote a series of popular online tutorials mixing code and
mathematics to describe imaging statistics in standard terms, including
smoothing, the general linear model and random field theory (see selected
tutorials).}
